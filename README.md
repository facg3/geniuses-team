# What are API:

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

# Different Types of APIs:

There are many different types of APIs for operating systems, applications or websites.
 Windows, for example, has many API sets that are used by system hardware and applications â€” when you copy
 and paste text from one application to another, it is the API that allows that to work.
Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide APIs, allowing programmers to write applications consistent with the operating environment. Today, APIs are also specified by websites.

For example, Amazon or eBay APIs allow developers to use the existing retail infrastructure to create specialized web stores. Third-party software developers also use Web APIs to create software solutions for end-users.

# User Stories:

We are developing a web app for a Game of Thrones series with the following requirements:
We want to be able to search for a character in the series and receive name of character,  gender, tittel  end photo.
We want to see behind name of character from the another API.



# What we doing :

First together we worked on the architecture of the code , then we chose the API that we will use it in our website , then we did a special function for use the 2 API, we use the output from the first API as a input to the secend API .
