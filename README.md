# What are APIs?

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.



# User Stories

We are developing a web app for a Game of Thrones series with the following requirements:
We want to be able to search for a character in the series and receive name of character,  gender, tittel  end photo.
We want to see behind name of character from the another API.



# What we doing :
First together we worked on the architecture of the code , then we chose the api that we will use it in our website.
